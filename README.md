# PracticeQuestions
<br>
I am targeting to practice 5 Questions/day for the 20 days from geeksforgeeks website.
So, I will get a total of 100 Questions at end of this.

### Questions of Day 1
<br>
1> Given two arrays A and B of size N and M respectively. The task is to find union between these two arrays. Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct    elements from both the arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in union. [Point 1]
   
2> Given an array of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order. [Points 2]

3> Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M      students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that : 1. Each student gets one packet. 2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students        having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.        [Points 2]
   
4> Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays. [Points 2]

5> Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements    are distinct. [Point 4]

### Questions of Day 2
<br>
1> Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum. [Points 2]

2> Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers      can be in any order. [Point 4]

3> Given an array arr[] of N integers arranged in a circular fashion. Your task is to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. [Points 8]

4> Given a square matrix[][] of size N x N. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. [Point 1]

5> Given a matrix mat[][] of size M*N. Traverse and print the matrix in spiral form. [Point 2]
