<b>Questions of Day 1</b>
1> Given two arrays A and B of size N and M respectively. 
   The task is to find union between these two arrays.
   Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both the arrays. 
   If there are repetitions, then only one occurrence of element should be printed in union. [Point 1]
   
2> Given an array of size N containing 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order. [Points 2]

3> Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. 
   Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
1. Each student gets one packet.
2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum. [Points 2]
   
4> Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays. [Points 2]

5> Given an array arr[] and a number K where K is smaller than size of array,
   the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. 
   It is given that all array elements are distinct. [Point 4]
